# Data-Mining-Business-Analytics-Project
For this project, a dataset of HR records about the employees of a company was provided. There were a number of attributes with a binary class label defining whether or not the 
employee left the company.

The scenario given as a project was that the management of the company has made this data available to their data scientists and expects to have meaningful visualizations and 
information which can help employees retention and facilitate managerial decisions. 

The only guidelines provided for this project were the end goals to be acheived and based on those, I had to decide the best possible techniques that could be applied.
